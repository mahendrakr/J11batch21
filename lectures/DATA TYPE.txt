             step 2 --- take value from bottom to top

binary to decimal =
e.g ---- convert binary (100) into decimal
              1 : multiply by 2^n (n = 0 ,1 ,2.....take value(0) from right to left)
              2 : 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0
              3 : 4+0+0 = 4

decimal to octal = divide by base 8
