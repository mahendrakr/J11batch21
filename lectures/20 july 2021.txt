Static Variable:- If the static keyword is used with a variable than it is called static variable
eg. static int a;

It will initiallize only once throughout its life.
It will use to represent common things or which objects state never get changed.
Static variable consumes less memory

Non static:-If the static keyword is not used with a variable than it is called non static variable/Instance variable
eg. int a;
It will get memory at object creation time.
It will initiallize again and again object is created
It will use to represent the state which keep on changing
It consumes more memory

Block:-{}
There are two types of block 
Static block
eg. static{}
It is used to initiallize static variable
To varify class is loaded or not
Non static block
eg. {}
It is use to initiallize instance variable
